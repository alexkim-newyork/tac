Create a sustainable open source support structure for Hyperledger Fabric v2.0 and beyond's new code deliveries, so that restore confidence in s390x as a viable, strong enterprise platform.
The current target version would need to support followings:

CouchDB 2.3 image doesn't exist for s390x
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-15429
https://github.com/apache/couchdb-docker/issues/67

Prebuilt grpc-node binaries don't exist for s390x
https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/issues/296

The community has worked around the 2 above by building their own forks of binaries.

Java chaincode image won't build for s390x
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-12108
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13629: no 8-jdk-alpine image for the s390x architecture
https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/6625: s390x protobuf-protoc fails 

Java chaincode is still relatively new in the fabric platform. 

Inconsistent network performance problems 
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-12927: Connection reset failure on cloning fabric repository on s390x platform
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-12106: fab-ca sample is failing on s390x build
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse-FAB-12822: Unit-test is failing "intermittently" on release-1.3 - s390x
